# Sounds-Of-The-Underground

The .ipynb file contains cells in the order that they need to be run for the project to function.
The .wav files provided are a sample of the data I gathered in the Skyline Caverns caves in Virginia.
This project can be run as is, with the audio file read in as it currently is, or it can be replaced with any of the other .wav files provided.

Background: This project was created in order to analyze and graph impulse response data that I recorded in various caves and caverns in Virginia. It specifically looks at the frequency response, reverb times, and early reflections.
